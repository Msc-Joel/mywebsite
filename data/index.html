    <h1>Introduction to Web Mapping with Mapbox</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This is an introductory guide as well as the basic steps in creating an interactive 
        web map displaying 2020 presidential election data. In this process I used Mapbox GL JS 
        as the main JavaScript library powering the interactive map.</p>

    <h3>Creating a Graduated Point Interactive Map</h3>

    <p>I also created a graduated point map and instead of the state and 
        county polygon layers I added the centroids I created.  First, I removed the two polygon layers
        from my map above. I also left the outlines of the counties and states that were 
        also generated from that data. Secondly I added the centroids layer, but style it as points. 
        The circle-radius gives the difference between Biden and Trump votes, in absolute values</p>
