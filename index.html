            <h3>1. Introduction to web maps with Mapbox</h3>
            <div class="header">
                <hr>
                <p>This is an introductory guide as well as the basic steps in creating an interactive 
                    web map displaying 2020 presidential election data. In this process I used Mapbox GL JS 
                    as the main JavaScript library powering the interactive map.</p>

                <h3>Creating a Graduated Point Interactive Map</h3>
            
                <p>I also created a graduated point map and instead of the state and 
                    county polygon layers I added the centroids I created.  First, I removed the two polygon layers
                    from my map above. I also left the outlines of the counties and states that were 
                    also generated from that data. Secondly I added the centroids layer, but style it as points. 
                    The circle-radius gives the difference between Biden and Trump votes, in absolute values</p>
